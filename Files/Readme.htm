The Bitmap object has been enhanced with several new properties that can be set at design time. The image of what it will look like is displayed in the Design Screen. At compile time, the image is transferred into a bitmap resource in the project, and saved as a file in \NSBasic_Symbian\bitmaps\<projectName>.		<p>The new properties are:<br>	   Gradient Color1: The top (or left) color.<br>	   Gradient Color2: The bottom (or right) color<br>	   Gradient Style:  1 for top to bottom, 0 for left to right.	   	<p>You can use a bitmap instead of a label of the same size. Since Bitmap objects can have a script (just like a Button object), BitMap object buttons work the same way as Button Object buttons - but there are more options on appearance.	<p><img src="images/fancybutton.bmp" alt="">		<li>Using other fonts: Bitmaps can now have text on them, using any font that is on your desktop system. The new properties are:<br>	Caption: The text to appear<br>	Alignment: 0 for left, 1 for right, 2 for centered.<br>	Appearance: 0 for flat, 1 for 3D<br>	Border Style: 0 for none, 1 for 1 border around the image.<br>	Caption Color: The color of the text.<br>	Font Name: The name of the font. Can use any font installed on your system.<br>	FontSize: The size of the letters.<br>	FontBold: Are the characters in boldface?<br>	FontItalic: Are the characters italicized?<br>	FontStrikeThru: Is there a line through the characters?<br>	FontUnderline: Is there a line under the characters?<br>		<LI><p>Sizing images on Bitmaps: You can now specify the image to appear on a bitmap as well as its size. The new properties are:<br>	Picture: The pathname to the image. It can be bmp, gif, jpg and other format.<br>	Stretch: If False, the image will be the size of the orginal image, aligned at the top left. If the image if larger than the bitmap object, it will be clipped. If Stretch is True, the image will be scaled to fit the current size of the bitmap object.		<p>Keep in mind that the maximum size of a bitmap is 65,512 bytes. The formula for calculating the size of a bitmap is (width * height) * 8.		<p>Projects with existing bitmap objects will continue to work as before. 		<li>FileLib: This new library allows flat files, such as .txt files, to be created, read and written. Since it lets you read and write directly to any position in the file, it can be used to access any file you know the format of. Files can be in main memory or on a card. The library also allows you to see the contents of the public directories of your device. There is a new <a href="http://www.nsbasic.com/symbian/info/technotes/TN23.htm" target="_top">Tech Note</a>, library and two samples. (This library replaces VFSLib. The calls are the same, but there are additional capabilities.)		<li><p>SetTheme(themeName) function: This new function lets you change the Theme at any time in your program. The Theme file has to be included in the Resources of the project. themeName is the name of the file, without an extension.	</ol><h4>What's new in 1.0.3</h4>This section describe features and fixes that are too new to be in the Language Reference or Handbook.<OL>	<li>IDE: Theme Editor added.	<li>IDE: Design screen shows colors in current theme	<li>IDE: Launch Icons and License now stored as relative paths	<li>Runtime: Theme support added.	<li>Library: Dictionary library added. (See Notes)	<li>Samples: Dictionary sample added.	<li><a href="http://www.nsbasic.com/symbian/info/technotes/TN42.htm" target="_top">TechNote 42</a> added: Using NSDictLib.</OL><h4>Documentation Notes for 1.0.3</h4><ol>	<li>Themes: This new feature allows you to enhance the appearance of your application by adding color to it. In Project Properties, you define a Theme. A theme defines colors for 22 different features of a form. There are 30 themes included with the release.		<p>To edit a theme or to create a new one, start the IDE and open a project. Select the Theme Editor under the Tools menu. It will automatically open the theme for the current form for editing, but allows you to also modify other themes or create new ones.			<p>Projects are automatically given the "Symbian" theme. Projects that are imported from NS Basic/Palm can be given the "Classic" theme if you want to retain the original look. There is no restriction on changing the theme of an existing program.		<p>The theme you specify in Project Properties will be automatically be added as a resource to your project. If you use additional themes, you have to add them as resources. Themes are kept in c:\NSBasic_Symbian\Themes. You can put additional themes you create in that folder or elsewhere.		<p>Note on the "Symbian" Theme: This theme is intended to be a good standard theme. We haven't come up with a final version of this. Feel free to contribute an improved version!		<li>Dictionary Object: The new object lets you set up a list of values you can quickly lookup and change during runtime. See Tech Note 42 and the new NSDictLib sample.</ol><h4>What's new in 1.0.2</h4>This section describe features and fixes that are too new to be in the Language Reference or Handbook.<OL>	<li>Compile: Version number now updates properly	<li>Compile: Spaces in the directory path are no longer a problem.	<li>Compile: Now works properly on non-English Vista systems.	<li>IDE: New forms default to no titlebar on top.	<lI>IDE: Bitmaps default to 8 Bit Hi Res (see below)	<li>Runtime: StyleTap updated to .9.013	<li>Runtime: Screen and font rendering much better at 240x240	<li>Runtime: TitleBar and MsgBox appearance improved.	<lI>Runtime: Cursor appearance improved.	<li>Runtime: Cursor no longer beeps when moved on some devices.	<li>Help: ReadMe is now in the Help menu.	<li>Help: Language Reference updated.	<li>Help: Several Tech Notes updated.	<li>Samples: Name of Stock Quote app changed.</OL><h4>Documentation Notes for 1.0.2</h4><ol>	<li>Bitmaps: When you add a bitmap to a project, it defaults to 8 bit, hi resolution. This will work well for devices which have an area of 240x240 or larger. If your device is smaller, you should put the bitmap into 8 bit, normal resolution, using the Project Exporer to get to the properties of your bitmap.		<p>The maximum size of a bitmap is 64k. If you specify more than one image in a bitmap, the total of all the images cannot exceed 64k. Note that the size used of the image is as a bitmap, which can be quite a bit larger than your original image if it is a gif or jpg.		<p>If you need to display an image larger than 64k, you need to tile it into smaller images that are within the limit and display them as separate bitmaps.</ol><h4>What's new in 1.0.1</h4>This section describe features and fixes that are too new to be in the Language Reference or Handbook.<OL>	<li>Samples: Stock Quote added.	<lI>Runtime: Grid.TextMatrix fixed.	<lI>Runtime: Localization preferences (dates, etc.) should work now.	<lI>Runtime: StyleTap updated to 0.9.012 	<li>Samples: Controls no longer hangs	<li>Installer: Files are now installed into c:\NSBasic_Symbian	<lI>Installer: Option added to start IDE or HelloWorld on completion	<lI>Installer: step added to register controls	<li>Compiler: Output files renamed for more clarity	<li>Compiler: Error 70 fixed.	<li>Compiler: S60 and UIQ installers can both be made in one run.</OL><h4>Documentation Notes for 1.0.1</h4>The default Files Directory, which is used to store projects, installers, samples and libraries has been changed from c:\NSBasic to c:\NSBasic_Symbian. This will avoid the confusion with NS Basic/Palm projects, which used the same directory. If you are using the default folder, you will need to move your projects from \NSBasic\Projects to \NSBasic_Symbian\Projects.<h4>Important Notes</h4><ol>	<lI><p>Projects: Your project is saved in a .prj file. When you compile, the following files are created in the c:\NSBasic_Symbian\Download folder. 	<ul>		<li>	The <code>_S60_selfsigned.sisx</code> file is a self signed installer for S60 devices.  Click on it and the Nokia Application Installer should transfer it to your device.		<li>	The <code>_UIQ_selfsigned.sis</code>  file is a self signed installer for UIQ devices.  Click on it and the UIQ Application Installer should transfer it to your device.</li>		<li>	The <code>_S60_unsigned.sis</code>  file is an unsigned installer for S60 devices that only appears in the Pro version. See Tech Note 11 for more information on signing.</li>		<li>	The <code>_UIQ_unsigned.sis</code>  file is an unsigned installer for UIQ devices that only appears in the Pro version. See Tech Note 11 for more information on signing.</li>		<li>	<code>Compile.log</code>  file contains all the messages from the compilation: send this to NS Basic with the Error.log file if the .sisx or .sis file is not created.</li>		<li>	<code>Error.log</code> , if it exists, will have messages from building the installer.</li>		<li>	The <code>.prc</code>  file is the actual executable.</li>	</ul>		<li><p>Make sure you are building for the correct type of device. In the Tools menu, select Options, then Compile/Download. In that screen, select either S60, UIQ or both.		<li><p>Signing: Symbian requires all apps be signed, a process specifying which apps will run on what devices, and what rights they have to do certain operations. By default, NS Basic/Symbian OS creates Self Signed apps. As these are not Trusted Apps, a setting has to be changed on some devices before they will install. See Tech Note 11 for more information on Signing.	<p>To create app with a higher level of signing than Self Signed, NS Basic/Symbian OS Pro is required.</li>		<li><p>(S60 Devices) To allow Self Signed apps to run, go to the Symbian Tools (or Installatons) menu on the device and look for the App Manager. Start it. Select 'Options', then 'Settings'. Change the "Software Installation" setting from "Signed Only" to "All".</li>		<li><p>(S60 Devices) To see what apps are running on your device, hit the app key on the device while your program is running. It goes back to the app menu. Your program continues running. Hold the app key down to get the task switcher to get it back. To resume running an app, hilite it and push the select key. To kill an app on a device with a QWERTY keyboard, hit the delete key.</li>		<li><p>Icons: See Tech Note 9 for complete details on creating icons for your app.</li>		<li><p>Terminating your App: On Symbian OS, when a new app starts, yours goes into the background (See above, "What apps are running?".) To actually stop your app, you need to actually execute an NS Basic STOP statement. It's in the Language Reference. (For those coming from the Palm OS environment, this is quite different from what you are used to.)</li>		<li><p>Installing Additional Files: You can include additional files in your installer by adding them to the Resource area of the Project Explorer. They will be installed in the same folder as your app. The same is true for Libraries.		<li><p>Install Location: By default, apps are installed in the "Installat." folder on S60 devices, and into Tools on UIQ devices. You can change this in Project Properties.		<p>Apps can be installed to the device or to a card. If they are installed to the device, they will launch more quickly, as the memory is faster.		<li><p>Data Files: Data files you create using the db* statements are created in your app's private directory on the device. If your app is deleted, the files are also deleted. If a newer version of your app is installed, the files are retained (make sure your installer does not overwrite them!) The security of the Symbian OS on its private folders is pretty good: you cannot read or write to these files from another app, which can make it difficult to copy files off the device. However, you can use the VFSLib to read and write files to a storage card, where they will be publicly accessable.		<LI><p>Make sure your firmware is up to date. We've seen some older devices with the original firmware on them that have problems. Updating the firmware seems to solve this. Check with your manufacturer.		<li><p>Unsupported Features: There are some features that are not yet completely in NS Basic/Symbian. Major ones are 5-Way support and Serial Communications. We plan to add these in a future release. (Not all Symbian devices have 5 way buttons.)		<li><p>Handbook: The Handbook documents 5-Way support in Section 15. Please ignore this section until we release support for this.</ol><hr><a name="bugs"><H3>4.
