<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><b>Why Develop for Symbian?</b>
<p>Because more people use it than all others combined. <p>Here is how the smartphone marketshare looks, as of the second quarter of 2008:

<p><b>Manufacturers</b>
<p>The biggest manufacturer of Symbian OS devices is Nokia. They are also, by far, the largest manufacturer of phones in the world. While they hold a small share of the North American marketplace, worldwide, they are the dominant manufacturer. This is the opposite of Palm, which has always been strongest in the US.

<p>Other manufacturers of Symbian OS phones include Sony Ericsson, Samsung, Motorola and LG.

<p><b>Devices</b>
<p>A much wider variety of devices is available than from Palm. Every possible form factor is manufactured, including touch and non-touch, candy bar, flip phone, slider phone, various keyboard layouts, with different screen sizes and resolutions, with cameras and without, etc. 

<p>While this creates opportunity, it also can be a challenge. Programs set up for one device may not run the exact same way on another. NS Basic/Symbian OS has a number of features to help deal with this.

<h3>The Operating System</h3>
Symbian OS is an operating system designed for use in mobile phones. While a few of its features are somewhat Windows like (there is a C drive, for example) it is a completely different operating system. It makes good use of the limited resources a smartphone has and has much better security. The user interface is separate from the operating system itself: the most commonly used ones for smartphones are S60 and UIQ.

	<p><b>Versions of the OS</b>
	
<p>The S60 Platform is the most commonly used user interface on SmartPhone devices. The latest version of it is 3rd edition: NS Basic/Symbian OS supports S60 Third Edition phones. The next edition will be the 5th Edition: no 4th Edition is expected. S60 is used on Nokia devices. Most S60 devices do not have touchscreens, but touch screen devices are expected in late 2008.

<p>The UIQ Platform is the next most commonly used platform. The latest version is 3.3. NS Basic/Symbian OS supports UIQ 3.x devices. UIQ devices are manufactured by Sony Ericsson and Motorola. Most UIQ devices have touchscreens.

<p>It has been announced that the Symbian OS will become open source. S60 and UIQ will be absorbed into the Symbian OS group and a single version, based on S60, will eventually appear.
