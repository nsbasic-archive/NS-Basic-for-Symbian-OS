It is easy to display color bitmaps in NS Basic/Symbian OS programs. <p>First, a bit of background on how NS Basic displays bitmaps. Devices come in different varieties: some can display a full set of colors, while other can only display simple black and white. Some can do settings in between.  There are 5 levels that can currently be displayed: 1 bit, 2 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit and 16 bit. A 1 bit (monochrome) device cannot display an 8 bit picture, nor can it convert it to something it can display. Therefore, for a program to run on all possible devices, you need to supply bitmaps in all for levels.

<p>Bitmaps are stored in your program as resources. NS Basic/Symbian OS creates a bitmap resource for each bitmap you add to the program, and gives it the 4 digit ID number you see in the Project Explorer. You can add a list of up to 5 paths to images for a single bitmap resource. Make sure the images you add to your project already have the correct bit depth for the place you are assigning them!

<p>Internally, NS Basic using a handy utility to do this called ResIn. It allows you to use .bmp, .gif, .jpg, ico, .emf or .wmf files as input: they are is used at runtime. It is in NS Basic Tools folder.

<p>This same utility is used create color icons for your application that are displayed in the StyleTap Launcher. It is not used for icons in the Symbian Launcher.

<p>Internally, the format of the ResIn command line is<br>
<code>ResIn.exe imageNames:n filename.prc resType resID</code>
<UL COMPACT>
	<LI><code>imageName</code> is the name of the image file. There can be up to 5. The value n following the image name is the bit depth. The images can be .bmp, .gif, .jpg, ico, .emf or .wmf format.
	<LI><code>filename.prc</code> is the name of the project you have generated.
	<LI><code>resType</code> is either Tbmp for a bitmap or tAIB for the icon
	<LI><code>resID</code> is the four digit ID number from the IDE. If you are creating an Icon, use 1000.
</UL>
Sample:<br>
<code>ResIn.exe a1.bmp:1 a2.bmp:2 a4.bmp:4 a8.bmp:8 ColorBitmap.prc Tbmp 1006</code>
