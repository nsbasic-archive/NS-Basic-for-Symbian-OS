<p>NS Basic's libraries are like dynamically linked libraries on desktop systems
and make functions and subroutines available to other programs. 
NS Basic provides a way to use many libraries
within an NSBasic program.  <a href="TN05a.htm">Tech Note 05a: Using Libraries</a> describes how to use a
library.  In addition, there are tech notes and examples for using many specific libraries.</p>

<p>Libraries come from several different sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are many libraries available from NSBasic, all free of charge.  In addition, there
are other libraries written for NSBasic by third parties.  There is a list of the ones known to
work at the end of this tech note.</li>
<li>You can write your own libraries in languages such as C, C++, and Pascal.  You cannot, however,
use NSBasic itself to write libraries.</li>
<li>Many, but not all, libraries available elsewhere can be adapted for use in NSBasic.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on writing and adapting libraries,
see <a href="TN05b.htm">Tech Note 05b: Writing and Adapting Libraries</a><p>

<p>A library for use with NSBasic has two components:</p>
<p>One is a file containing the library.  The name ends in <code>.prc</code>.  This file must be
included as a resource in each NS Basic app that will use the library.  These files should be kept in the Download folder within
the NS Basic OS install folder (<i>e.g.</i> <code>C:\NSBasic\Download</code>). </p>

<p>The other is an information file, whose name ends in <code>.inf</code>.  These files are kept in the Libs folder 
within the NSBasic install folder (<i>e.g.</i> <code>C:\NSBasic\Lib</code>).  Information files provide information 
for the IDE to use when constructing calls to libraries.  They are not downloaded onto the device.  The process of
adapting a library to run under NS Basic, when possible, only requires changing the information file.  There are two
versions of information files.  The main difference is that version 2 provides automatic type checking.  All new development
should use version 2.  Version 1 is deprecated, but there are still some of this version around.  For more information, see
<a href="TN05a.htm">Using Libraries</a>.</p>

<h3>List of Libraries</h3>

<p>This is a list libraries and extensions that are known to work with NS Basic/Symbian OS.  If you know of additional libraries that should be listed here, <A HREF="support&copy; nsbasic.com">please let us know</A>.</p>
