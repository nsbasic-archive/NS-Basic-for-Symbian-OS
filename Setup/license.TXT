Please note there are three Agreements here. One is for
NS BASIC Corporation, the second for StyleTap, and the third
for Nokia Corporation. By accepting this, you are agreeing to 
all Agreements.

LICENSE AGREEMENT

PLEASE READ THIS LICENSE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SOFTWARE. 
BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE 
TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF 
THIS LICENSE, PROMPTLY RETURN THE PRODUCT TO THE PLACE WHERE 
YOU OBTAINED IT AND YOUR MONEY WILL BE REFUNDED. 

1. License. The application, demonstration, system, and other 
software accompanying this License, whether on disk, in read 
only memory, or on any other media (the "Software"), the 
related documentation and fonts are licensed to you by NS 
BASIC Corporation ("NSBC"). You own the media on which the 
Software and fonts are recorded but NSBC and or NSBC's 
Licenser(s) and suppliers retain title to the Software, 
related documentation and fonts and are protected by United 
States copyright laws, by laws of other nations and 
international treaties. This License allows you to use the 
Software and fonts on a single Windows Product (which, for 
purposes of this License, shall mean a product bearing 
Microsoft's Windows logo), and make one copy of the Software 
and fonts in machine-readable form for backup purposes only. 
You must reproduce on such copy the NSBC copyright notice and 
any other proprietary legends that were on the original copy 
of the Software and fonts. You may also transfer all your 
license rights in the Software and fonts, the backup copy of 
the Software and fonts, the related documentation and a copy 
of this License to another party, provided the other party 
reads and agrees to accept the terms and conditions of this 
License.  

2. Restrictions. The Software contains copyrighted material, 
trade secrets and other proprietary material and in order to 
protect them you may not decompile, reverse engineer, 
disassemble or otherwise reduce the Software to a human-
perceivable form. You may not modify, network, rent, lease, 
load, distribute or create derivative works based upon the 
Software in whole or in part. You may not electronically 
transmit the Software from one device to another or over a 
network.  

3. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. 
You may terminate this License at any time by destroying the 
Software and related documentation and fonts. This License 
will terminate immediately without notice from NSBC if you 
fail to comply with any provision of this License. Upon 
termination you must destroy the Software, related 
documentation and fonts.  

4. Export Law Assurances. You agree and certify that neither 
the Software nor any other technical data received from NSBC, 
nor the direct product thereof, will be exported outside the 
United States except as authorized and as permitted by the 
laws and regulations of the United States. If the Software 
has been rightfully obtained by you outside of the United 
States, you agree that you will not reexport the Software 
nor any other technical data received from NSBC, nor the 
direct product thereof, except as permitted by the laws and 
regulations of the United States and the laws and regulations 
of the jurisdiction in which you obtained the Software.  

5. Government End Users. If you are acquiring the Software 
and fonts on behalf of any unit or agency of the United 
States Government, the following provisions apply. The 
Government agrees: (i) if the Software and fonts are 
supplied to the Department of Defense (DoD), the Software 
and fonts are classified as "Commercial Computer Software" 
and the Government is acquiring only "restricted rights" in 
the Software, its documentation and fonts as that term is 
defined in Clause 252.227-7013(c)(1) of the DFARS; and (ii) 
if the Software and fonts are supplied to any unit or agency 
of the United States Government other than DoD, the 
Governments' rights in the Software, its documentation and 
fonts will be as defined in Clause 52.227-19(c)(2) of the 
FAR or, in the case of NASA, in Clause 18-52.227-86(d) of the 
NASA supplement to the FAR.  

6. NS BASIC will replace at no charge defective disks or 
manuals within 90 days of the date of purchase. NS BASIC 
warranties that the programs will perform generally in 
compliance with the included documentation. NS BASIC does not 
warrant that the programs and manuals are free from all bugs, 
errors or omissions. 

7. Disclaimer of Warranty on Software. You expressly 
acknowledge and agree that use of the Software and fonts is 
at your sole risk. The Software, related documentation and 
fonts are provided "AS IS" and without warranty of any kind 
and NSBC and NSBC's Licenser(s) (for the purposes of 
provisions 7 and 8, NSBC and NSBC's Licenser(s) shall be 
collectively referred to as "NSBC") EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL 
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NSBC DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS 
CONTAINED IN THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT 
THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-
FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE AND THE FONTS WILL BE 
CORRECTED. FURTHERMORE, NSBC DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY 
REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF 
THE SOFTWARE AND FONTS OR RELATED DOCUMENTATION IN TERMS OF 
THEIR CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. NO 
ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY NSBC OR A NSBC 
AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY 
WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS WARRANTY. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE 
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU (AND NOT NSBC OR AN NSBC AUTHORIZED 
REPRESENTATIVE) ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY 
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT 
ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE 
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. This limited warranty gives 
you specific rights. You may have others, which vary from 
state to state. LICENSOR'S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE 
REMEDY SHALL BE, AT LICENSOR'S CHOICE, EITHER (A) RETURN OF 
THE PRICE PAID OR (B) REPLACEMENT OF THE SOFTWARE THAT DOES 
NOT MEET LICENSOR'S LIMITED WARRANTY AND WHICH IS RETURNED 
TO LICENSOR WITH A COPY OF YOUR RECEIPT. Any replacement 
Software will be warranted for the remainder of the original 
warranty period or 30 days, whichever is longer. This Limited 
Warranty is void if failure of the Software has resulted from 
modification, accident, abuse, or misapplication.

8. Limitation of Liability. Because software is inherently 
complex and may not be free from errors, you are advised to 
verify the work produced by the Program. UNDER NO 
CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, SHALL NSBC BE LIABLE FOR 
ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT RESULT 
FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR RELATED 
DOCUMENTATION, EVEN IF NSBC OR A NSBC AUTHORIZED 
REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR 
EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY 
TO YOU. In no event shall NSBC's total liability to you for 
all damages, losses, and causes of action (whether in contract, 
tort (including negligence) or otherwise) exceed the amount 
paid by you for the Software and fonts. 

9. Allocation of Risk: You acknowledge and agree that this 
Agreement allocates risk between you and NSBC as authorized 
by the Uniform Commercial Code and other applicable law and 
that the pricing of NSBC's products reflects this allocation 
of risk and the limitations of liability contained in this 
Agreement. If any remedy hereunder is determined to have 
failed of its essential purpose, all limitations of liability 
and exclusions of damages as set forth in this Agreement will 
remain in effect.

10. Support. NSBC may, at its option, provide support services 
at its standard fees for such services. Such support services 
will be governed by the limitations of liability under this 
Agreement.

11. Additional Restrictions: Any upgrade or enhancement of the 
program subsequently supplied by NSBC may only be used upon 
the destruction of the prior version, and shall be governed 
by the terms of this Agreement.

12. Controlling Law and Severability. This License shall be 
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the 
United States and the State of Delaware, as applied to 
agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within 
Delaware between Delaware residents. If for any reason a 
court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this 
License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that 
provision of the License shall be enforced to the maximum 
extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, 
and the remainder of this License shall continue in full force 
and effect.  

13. Complete Agreement. This License constitutes the entire 
agreement between the parties with respect to the use of the 
Software, related documentation and fonts, and supersedes all 
prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written 
or oral, regarding such subject matter. No amendment to or 
modification of this License will be binding unless in 
writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of 
NSBC.

COPYRIGHT LICENSE

NOKIA CORPORATION END-USER SOFTWARE AGREEMENT 

This Software Agreement ("Agreement") is between You (either an individual or an entity), the End User, and Nokia Corporation ("Nokia"). The Agreement authorizes You to use the Software specified in Clause 1 below, which may be stored on a CD-ROM, sent to You by electronic mail, or downloaded from Nokia's Web pages or Servers or from other sources under the terms and conditions set forth below.

This is an agreement on end-user rights and not an agreement for sale. Nokia continues to own the copy of the Software and the physical media contained in the sales package and any other copy that You are authorized to make pursuant to this Agreement. You also acknowledge that the Software contains portions of software licensed by Symbian Software Limited whose registered office is situated at 2-6 Boundary Row, London SE1 8HP, UK ("Symbian") or its third party licensors and which has been licensed to Nokia under a separate agreement between Nokia and Symbian.

Read this Agreement carefully before installing, downloading, or using the Software. By clicking on the "I Accept" button while installing, downloading, and/or using the Software, You agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If You do not agree to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, promptly click the "Decline" or "I Do Not Accept" button, cancel the installation or downloading, or destroy or return the Software and accompanying documentation to Nokia. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTAND IT, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. SOFTWARE

As used in this Agreement, the term "Software" means, collectively: (i) the software product identified above (ii) all the contents of the disk(s), CD-ROM(s), electronic mail and its file attachments, or other media with which this Agreement is provided, including the object code form of the software delivered via a CD-ROM, electronic mail, or Web page (iii) digital images, stock photographs, clip art, or other artistic works ("Stock Files") (iv) related explanatory written materials and any other possible documentation related thereto ("Documentation"); (v) fonts, and (vi) upgrades, modified versions, updates, additions, and copies of the Software (collectively "Updates"), if any, licensed to You by Nokia under this Agreement.

You acknowledge that the use of the Software may require licenses to third party patents and that Nokia does not grant any licenses to such third party patents under this Agreement to the You.  Also, any and all standards related licenses with respect to Essential Patents (as defined below) are specifically excluded from the scope of this Agreement, and those licenses need to be acquired separately from Nokia or the respective right holders, as the case may be. “Essential Patent” means any patent claiming a feature necessarily and unavoidably required for compliance with industry standards (usually GSM, WCDMA or other similar mobile communications standard), to the limited extent only that infringement or use of such claims of a patent cannot be avoided in remaining compliant with industry standard either for technological reasons or for lack of commercially viable technical alternatives.  

No patent licenses to any patents of Nokia and/ or its Affiliates are granted under this Agreement.  

3. LIMITATIONS ON END USER RIGHTS

(d) Unless stated otherwise in the Documentation, You shall not display, modify, reproduce, or distribute any of the Stock Files included with the Software. In the event that the Documentation allows You to display the Stock Files, You shall not distribute the Stock Files on a stand-alone basis, i.e., in circumstances in which the Stock Files constitute the primary value of the product being distributed. You should review the "Readme" files associated with the Stock Files that You use to ascertain what rights You have with respect to such materials. Stock Files may not be used in the production of libelous, defamatory, fraudulent, infringing, lewd, obscene, or pornographic material or in any otherwise illegal manner. You may not register or claim any rights in the Stock Files or derivative works thereof. 

(e) You agree that You shall only use the Software in a manner that complies with all applicable laws in the jurisdiction in which You use the Software, including, but not limited to, applicable restrictions concerning copyright and other intellectual property rights.

The Software and all rights, without limitation including title and intellectual property rights therein, are owned by Nokia and/or its licensors and affiliates and are protected by international treaty provisions and all other applicable national laws of the country in which it is being used. The structure, organization, and code of the Software are the valuable trade secrets and confidential information of Nokia and/or its licensors and affiliates. You must not copy the Software, except as set forth in clause 3 (Limitations On End-User Rights). Any copies which You are permitted to make pursuant to this Agreement must contain the same copyright and other proprietary notices that appear on the Software. You specifically agree and acknowledge that you shall include and maintain a copyright notice in any application developed with equal prominence to that given any other copyright notice as follows: "This Application includes software licensed from Symbian Software Ltd © 1998-200[4]".

You may not rent, lease, sublicense, lend, or transfer versions or copies of the Software You do not use. If the Software is an Update to a previous version of the Software, You must possess valid end-user rights to such a previous version in order to use the Update, and You may use the previous version for ninety (90) days after You receive the Update in order to assist You in the transition to the Update. After such time You no longer have a right to use the previous version, except for the sole purpose of enabling You to install the Update.

6. COMMENCEMENT & TERMINATION

This Agreement is effective from the first date You install the Software. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by permanently deleting, destroying, and returning, at Your own costs, the Software, all backup copies, and all related materials provided by Nokia. Your end-user rights automatically and immediately terminate without notice from Nokia if You fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement. In such an event, You must immediately delete, destroy, or return at Your own cost, the Software, all backup copies, and all related material to Nokia.
