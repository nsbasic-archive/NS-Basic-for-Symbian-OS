    Make sure you abide by all relevant copyright and licensing rules when
    ripping fonts.  In the U.S., bitmapped fonts (which is all that this
    extracts) are currently not copyrightable (but I am not a lawyer).
    Elsewhere, check your local laws.  Moreover, even in the U.S., rights you
    might have under copyright law can be curtailed by licensing provisions.


- extractfont can handle pdb files, and always generates text output.

- topalmtext and to*.tcl can accept Palm font resources (including in text
  format) as input, in which case all parameters and options are ignored (the
  font size must be specified but is ignored) for that resource.

- togray checks if the input is a grayscale font.  If not, it processes the font
  into a FontTypeV1 or FontTypeV2 resource instead.
