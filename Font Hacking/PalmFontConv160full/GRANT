The following additional license grant does NOT apply to the URW font code or
to the stdfixedfont_x2.txt font (in locales where the latter is copyrightable):

You may distribute the PalmFontConv project, minus the URW fonts and
stdfixedfont_x2.txt, in executable format under the terms of the GPL minus
the requirement for you to make available the source code for:
 (a) the unmodified FreeType 2 library even if statically linked to the binaries
 (b) an ANSI or POSIX C library even if statically linked to the binaries
 (c) a standard TCL/TK interpreter even if included as part of the package in
     a way that makes it be part of a derivative work,
providing that ALL of the following conditions are satisfied:
  (i) The version of the FreeType 2 library linked in is either an official
      release or a beta version from the official FreeType 2 project
      (www.freetype.org)
 (ii) The use of the FreeType 2 library is acknowledged as per the FreeType 2
      alternative license.  Inclusion of the PalmFontConv README.TXT file
      should be sufficient.
(iii) The FreeType 2 library is compiled in a way that does not make the
      resulting code infringe on any U.S. patents.
 (iv) The FreeType 2 library is compiled in a way that does not make the
      resulting code infringe on any patents at your location.
  (v) All necessary copyright acknowledgments, say for ComboBox.tcl, are included.
(vi) This GRANT file is included in the distribution.
All the other license requirements of the GPL remain, including the obligation
to make available all other source code in a derivative work, with only (a), (b)
and (c) being exempted.  Copying of PalmFontConv code, whether in source or
executable format, in contravention to the GPL as modified above is a violation
of copyright law.
