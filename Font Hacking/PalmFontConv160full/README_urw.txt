These fonts are based on the donated URW PostScript fonts taken from
www.gimp.org/fonts.html, also available for download at palmfontconv.sf.net and
which also should be available from whatever site you downloaded this (perhaps
as part of a palmfontconv distribution).

At least in the U.S., BITMAP fonts are not at all copyrighted.  If so, you may
have rights going over and beyond the GPL with regard to the font bitmaps 
generated by PalmFontConv (though not with regard to the PostScript source fonts).


If you have an OS4 Sony unit, use the *-sony-os4.prc fonts and if you have an
OS5+ hi-res unit, use the *-os5.prc fonts.


The fonts are converted by the utilities at palmfontconv.sf.net.
URW font source code is also available at
http://palmgear.com/index.cfm?xyz=52361

Scripts urwgen* and quickFS*.pl were used for FontSmoother font generation.
